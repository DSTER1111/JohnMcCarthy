    <h3>Noteable Contributions</h3>
    <p>Throughout his near 50 year career in Computer Science Technologies,
      John McCarthy made a multitude of advancements in the field and has even
      been called "The Father of AI". AI meaning "Artificial Intelligence",
      which is a term that John himself coined in 1955. He is most noted for
      this, writing the LISP Programming Language in 1958, and Inventing the
      first type of computer intelligence in 1978. For all of the revolutionary

      <h3>Additional Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>John McCarthy attended Princeton University, an incredibly prestigous
            school, and graduated with a Ph.D in Mathematics.
          </li>
        <li>McCarthy was a well liked professor at MIT and was often refered to as 
          "Uncle John" by his colleagues and students.
        </li>
        <li>Like most "genius's", John was obsessed with math and learning. In fact,
          He graduated High School 2 years early and skipped the first 2 years of
          college, but his devotion to Math caused him to fail PE, which forced him
          to join the US Army to retake the credit.
        </li>
        <li>Almost every online game now uses some type of AI, but John McCarthy
          created the first of these AI's when he programmed a computer that could
          play chess. It would take days to make 1 move but hey, it still worked!
